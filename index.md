I am the Boeing Endowed Professor at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). I moved to UW in 2017 after 18 years{% sidenote 'sn-geekwire' 'GeekWire has a couple of articles about the [move](https://www.geekwire.com/2017/robotics-expert-moves-entire-team-university-washington-including-famous-oreo-cracking-robot/) and my continued love for [Pittsburgh](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/pittsburgh-profile-robotics-expert-sidd-srinivasa-love-steel-city-leap-seattle/).'%} at [The Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I founded the 
[Personal Robotics Lab](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/) in 2005. I am an [IEEE Fellow](https://www.washington.edu/news/2017/11/28/two-uw-professors-elevated-to-ieee-fellows/) for _contributions to robotic manipulation and human-robot interaction_.

I enjoy proving theorems{% sidenote 'sn-lazy' 'Our work on Lazy Planning has won back to back best paper awards at [ICAPS 2018](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/haghtalab2018laziness.pdf) and [ICAPS 2019](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/mandalika2019gls.pdf).'%} and designing algorithms

I have led large projects, including [Intel's research in robotics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-4PTyQ8RX8), the [Quality of Life Technologies NSF ERC](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/srinivasa2012herb.pdf), the [DARPA ARM-S](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/king2013pregrasp.pdf), [DARPA Robotics Challenge](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/dellin2014guided.pdf), and most recently the HONDA Curious Minded Machine program. I was an author of the [Roadmap for US Robotics](http://archive2.cra.org/ccc/files/docs/2013-Robotics-Roadmap) that was presented to Congress in 2013, ran [RSS Robotics: Science and Systems 2017](http://rss2017.lids.mit.edu/), and am an Editor for [The International Journal of Robotics Research](http://journals.sagepub.com/home/ijr).

My lab has over [100 alumni](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/people/). My PhD students and postdocs are faculty at top schools (Berkeley, CMU, Michigan, Technion, USC, ...), industry (Boston Dynamics, Facebook, Google, iRobot, Waymo, ...), and startups. 
Together we have developed software frameworks such as [OpenRAVE](http://openrave.org/) and [DART](https://dartsim.github.io/).

I am a _first wave founder_ of [Berkshire Grey](https://www.berkshiregrey.com), which focuses on material handling.
I also enjoy consulting with industry. 

I have been [live on the BBC](https://twitter.com/HERB_UW/status/931711971732307968), on the cover of [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2011/08/robots/), and have an [IMDB page,](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7961061/)

I am deeply committed to STEM, and always excited to talk about robots to a [broad audience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25OQuThxKCc).

Nowadays, I like to [run competitively](https://www.athlinks.com/athletes/130400313). I captained the CMU squash team, and played tennis and badminton for IIT Madras.
